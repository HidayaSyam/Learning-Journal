## What is a growth mindset?
#### A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

#### By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

## Here’s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:

1. **Challenges**

      **When you faced a challenging problem  When you are ready, I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward. And for me, it always helps to talk through these steps – out loud, not just in my head. I jot down clues as they come about. Soon enough (and rather miraculously), I begin to find root causes of the problem.**
      
2. **Obstacles**

    **In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Persig talks about the “gumption trap” – the phenomenon of knowing what needs to be done, but lacking the motivation to do it. His solution is to stand up, put down whatever project is sucking the gumption out of you, walk away, and return when you’re feeling more inspired. Now, granted, this isn’t often a viable option for projects at work, but just recognizing what’s happening (I’m avoiding and losing focus) helps me make peace with it, and usually un-traps just enough of my gumption to do one more thing on the project. Then another one more thing. Then another. And so on. Eventually, enough momentum builds up and I’m back in the groove.**
3. **Effort**

   **when I find Yourself reaching for the snooze button, you consider all this. I make a conscious effort to stop and think about the growth mindset. I ask yourself, is going back to sleep really what I want to do? Am I giving up too easily? Would I rather shower off pangs of regret, or the sweat of accomplishment? C’mon, the answers are obvious.**
4. **Criticism**

    **I also find it useful to review each of your days and assess how you’ve done**
     _**So you should learned to ask yourself two questions:**_

      * What was the best part of the day?
      * What went wrong, and how can you make sure it doesn’t happen again?
   **These questions help you focus on all aspects of my day, the good and the bad, and they help me internalize strategies for creating more good days going forward.**

**And it turns out, variations of these questions help me process criticism from coworkers. Assuming their critique is valid (and it usually is), you can hold a mini-retrospective with yourself:**
       Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
      What can you do to improve the aspects I’m less proud of?
      That’s the dark side of growth, I guess…
5. **Success of others**
    **It might not be possible to retrofit a company to have a similar level of openness and commitment to authenticity, but it’s not too hard to adopt the growth mindset concepts to influence peer interactions. We can choose to be more transparent or more helpful than might be required or than we’re used to. In other words, we can choose to go the extra mile, we can choose to be quick to praise and slow to criticize. We can choose to seek first to understand.**
